# NLP-LangChain

This project demonstrates the implementation of LangChain, a framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). The implementation is done using Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

LangChain is a powerful open-source framework that enables the development of sophisticated AI applications by providing a modular architecture, advanced prompt engineering techniques, and seamless integration with external data sources. This project focuses on using LangChain for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, classification, and summarization.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily customize and swap components.
- **Unified Interface**: Interact with multiple LLMs using a consistent interface.
- **Memory Management****: Maintain context and continuity in conversations.
- **Agent Functionality**: Perform complex tasks using autonomous agents.
- **Integration with External Data Sources**: Access and utilize various data sources.
- **Custom Modules**: Create tailored modules for specific tasks.
- **Templates and Prompt Engineering**: Use advanced prompt engineering techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing and Postprocessing**: Ensure data is in the desired format.
